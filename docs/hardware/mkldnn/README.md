## Usage

### Checking for MKL-DNN Availability

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.mkldnn import is_mkldnn_available

if is_mkldnn_available():
    print("MKL-DNN is available")
else:
    print("MKL-DNN is not available")
```

### Creating a MKL-DNN Backend

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.mkldnn import MKLDNNBackend

# Create the backend
try:
    mkldnn = MKLDNNBackend()
    
    # Initialize the backend
    if mkldnn.initialize():
        print("MKL-DNN backend initialized successfully")
    else:
        print("Failed to initialize MKL-DNN backend")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"MKL-DNN error: {e}")
```

### Getting Device Information

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.mkldnn import MKLDNNBackend

# Create and initialize the backend
mkldnn = MKLDNNBackend()
mkldnn.initialize()

# Get the number of available devices
device_count = mkldnn.get_device_count()
print(f"Available MKL-DNN devices: {device_count}")

# Get information about a specific device
device_info = mkldnn.get_device_info(0)  # First device
print(f"Device info: {device_info}")
```

### Using MKL-DNN for Tensor Operations

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.hardware.mkldnn import MKLDNNBackend

# Create tensors
a = nx.Tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = nx.Tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Create and initialize the backend
mkldnn = MKLDNNBackend()
mkldnn.initialize()

# Perform matrix multiplication using MKL-DNN
c = mkldnn.matmul(a, b)
print(f"Result: {c}")
```

### Using MKL-DNN for Convolution

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.hardware.mkldnn import MKLDNNBackend

# Create input and weight tensors
input = nx.random.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)  # Batch, Channels, Height, Width
weight = nx.random.randn(16, 3, 3, 3)  # Out channels, In channels, Kernel H, Kernel W

# Create and initialize the backend
mkldnn = MKLDNNBackend()
mkldnn.initialize()

# Perform 2D convolution using MKL-DNN
output = mkldnn.conv2d(
    input=input,
    weight=weight,
    bias=None,
    stride=(1, 1),
    padding=(1, 1)
)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

### Using MKL-DNN for LSTM Operations

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.hardware.mkldnn import MKLDNNBackend

# Create input and hidden state tensors
batch_size = 1
seq_length = 10
input_size = 20
hidden_size = 30

input = nx.random.randn(seq_length, batch_size, input_size)
h0 = nx.random.randn(batch_size, hidden_size)
c0 = nx.random.randn(batch_size, hidden_size)
hidden = (h0, c0)
weight_ih = nx.random.randn(4 * hidden_size, input_size)
weight_hh = nx.random.randn(4 * hidden_size, hidden_size)
bias_ih = nx.random.randn(4 * hidden_size)
bias_hh = nx.random.randn(4 * hidden_size)

# Create and initialize the backend
mkldnn = MKLDNNBackend()
mkldnn.initialize()

# Perform LSTM operation using MKL-DNN
output, (h_n, c_n) = mkldnn.lstm(
    input=input,
    hidden=(h0, c0),
    weight_ih=weight_ih,
    weight_hh=weight_hh,
    bias_ih=bias_ih,
    bias_hh=bias_hh
)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
print(f"Final hidden state shape: {h_n.shape}")
print(f"Final cell state shape: {c_n.shape}")
```

## Implementation Details

The MKL-DNN backend implementation in Phynexus follows a layered architecture:

1. **Python API Layer**: Provides a user-friendly interface for MKL-DNN operations
2. **Rust Binding Layer**: Connects the Python API to the C++ implementation
3. **C++ Implementation Layer**: Implements the core MKL-DNN functionality

### Engine and Stream Management

The implementation uses MKL-DNN's engine and stream abstractions:

1. **Engine**: Represents a computational device (CPU)
2. **Stream**: Represents a queue of operations to be executed on an engine

These abstractions allow for efficient execution and synchronization of operations.

### Memory Management

The implementation includes sophisticated memory management:

1. **Memory Descriptors**: Define the logical organization of data
2. **Memory Objects**: Represent actual data in memory
3. **Memory Format Propagation**: Automatically select optimal memory formats
4. **Reorder Primitives**: Handle format conversions when necessary

### Primitive Management

MKL-DNN operations are represented as primitives:

1. **Primitive Descriptors**: Define the operation and its parameters
2. **Primitives**: Executable objects that perform the operation
3. **Primitive Caching**: Reuse primitives for repeated operations

## Best Practices

### Memory Format Optimization

For optimal performance with MKL-DNN:

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.hardware.mkldnn import MKLDNNBackend

# Create and initialize the backend
mkldnn = MKLDNNBackend()
mkldnn.initialize()

# When creating tensors, let MKL-DNN choose the optimal memory format
# (In a real implementation, this would be handled internally)
```

### Primitive Reuse

Reuse primitives for repeated operations:

```python
# Python
# In a real implementation, the MKLDNNBackend class would cache primitives internally
# for repeated operations with the same parameters
```

### Data Type Selection

Choose appropriate data types for your workload:

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.hardware.mkldnn import MKLDNNBackend

# Create and initialize the backend
mkldnn = MKLDNNBackend()
mkldnn.initialize()

# For inference, consider using lower precision
# (In a real implementation, this would be configurable)
```

3. **Limited Operations**: Not all operations are optimized for MKL-DNN
4. **Library Dependency**: Requires MKL-DNN library installation
5. **Implementation Status**: Some features are still in development

## Future Work

Future development of the MKL-DNN backend will focus on:

1. **Migration Path**: Providing a smooth migration path to oneDNN
2. **Compatibility Layer**: Ensuring compatibility with older systems
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Further tuning for different Intel architectures
4. **Feature Parity**: Ensuring feature parity with the oneDNN backend
5. **Documentation**: Improving documentation for migration from MKL-DNN to oneDNN
