# NPU Support in Phynexus

This document describes the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) support in the Phynexus framework.

## Overview

Neural Processing Units (NPUs) are specialized hardware accelerators designed specifically for neural network inference and training. Unlike general-purpose GPUs, NPUs are optimized for the specific computational patterns of neural networks, offering higher performance and energy efficiency for AI workloads. Phynexus includes support for various NPU architectures, enabling efficient execution of AI models on devices ranging from mobile phones to edge devices and specialized AI hardware.

The NPU backend in Phynexus leverages vendor-specific SDKs and APIs to provide a unified interface for neural network execution across different NPU architectures, while maintaining the same programming model used for other hardware backends.

## Features

The NPU backend in Phynexus provides:

- High-performance tensor operations optimized for NPU execution
- Automatic quantization for INT8/INT16 precision
- Efficient memory management for NPU devices
- Support for various NPU architectures (mobile NPUs, edge NPUs, data center NPUs)
- Seamless integration with the rest of the framework

## Hardware Requirements

NPU support in Phynexus requires:

- Device with a compatible NPU
- Appropriate drivers and SDKs installed

Compatible hardware includes:
- Mobile NPUs (Qualcomm Hexagon, MediaTek APU, Samsung Exynos NPU, Apple Neural Engine)
- Edge NPUs (Google Edge TPU, Intel Movidius, Arm Ethos-N)
- Data center NPUs (Habana Gaudi, Graphcore IPU, Groq TSP)

## Usage

### Checking for NPU Availability

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.npu import is_npu_available

if is_npu_available():
    print("NPU is available")
else:
    print("NPU is not available")
```

### Creating an NPU Backend

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.npu import NPUBackend

# Create the backend
try:
    npu = NPUBackend()
    
    # Initialize the backend
    if npu.initialize():
        print("NPU backend initialized successfully")
    else:
        print("Failed to initialize NPU backend")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"NPU error: {e}")
```

### Getting Device Information

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.npu import NPUBackend

# Create and initialize the backend
npu = NPUBackend()
npu.initialize()

# Get the number of available devices
device_count = npu.get_device_count()
print(f"Available NPU devices: {device_count}")

# Get information about a specific device
device_info = npu.get_device_info(0)  # First device
print(f"Device info: {device_info}")
```

### Using NPU for Tensor Operations

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.hardware.npu import NPUBackend

# Create tensors
a = nx.Tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = nx.Tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Create and initialize the backend
npu = NPUBackend()
npu.initialize()

# Perform matrix multiplication using NPU
c = npu.matmul(a, b)
print(f"Result: {c}")
```

### Optimizing a Model for NPU

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.nn import Sequential, Conv2d, ReLU, Linear
from neurenix.hardware.npu import NPUBackend

# Create a model
model = Sequential(
    Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
    ReLU(),
    Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),
    ReLU(),
    Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),
    ReLU(),
    Linear(64 * 8 * 8, 10)
)

# Create and initialize the backend
npu = NPUBackend()
npu.initialize()

# Optimize the model for NPU
optimized_model = npu.optimize_model(
    model=model,
    quantize=True,  # Enable quantization for better performance
    precision="int8"  # Use INT8 precision
)

print("Model optimized for NPU")
```

## Implementation Details

The NPU backend implementation in Phynexus follows a layered architecture:

1. **Python API Layer**: Provides a user-friendly interface for NPU operations
2. **Rust Binding Layer**: Connects the Python API to the C++ implementation
3. **C++ Implementation Layer**: Implements the core NPU functionality

### NPU Integration

The implementation uses vendor-specific NPU APIs to:

1. Initialize the NPU device
2. Allocate memory on the NPU
3. Transfer data between host and NPU
4. Execute operations on the NPU
5. Manage resources efficiently

### Quantization Support

The implementation includes support for quantization:

1. **INT8 Quantization**: 8-bit integer quantization for maximum performance
2. **INT16 Quantization**: 16-bit integer quantization for better accuracy
3. **Dynamic Quantization**: Runtime quantization based on tensor values
4. **Calibration**: Tools for calibrating quantization parameters

### Vendor-Specific Optimizations

## Best Practices

### Model Optimization

For optimal performance on NPUs:

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.npu import NPUBackend

# Create and initialize the backend
npu = NPUBackend()
npu.initialize()

# Optimize the model with quantization
optimized_model = npu.optimize_model(
    model=model,
    quantize=True,
    precision="int8",
    optimize_for="performance"  # Prioritize performance over accuracy
)
```

### Memory Management

For efficient memory usage:

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.npu import NPUBackend

# Create and initialize the backend
npu = NPUBackend()
npu.initialize()

# Set memory limit
npu.set_memory_limit(1024 * 1024 * 100)  # 100 MB

# Enable memory optimization
npu.enable_memory_optimization(True)
```

### Batch Size Selection

Choose appropriate batch sizes for NPUs:

```python
# Python
# For mobile NPUs, use smaller batch sizes
batch_size = 1

# For data center NPUs, use larger batch sizes
batch_size = 16
```

## Framework Comparison

### Neurenix vs. TensorFlow

| Feature | Neurenix | TensorFlow |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **NPU Support** | Comprehensive support for various NPUs | Limited to specific NPUs (TPU, Edge TPU) |
| **Unified API** | Same API across all hardware | Different APIs for different hardware |

| **Edge Deployment** | Direct deployment | Requires conversion |
| **Performance Optimization** | Automatic optimization | Manual optimization |

Neurenix provides more comprehensive NPU support compared to TensorFlow, with a unified API that works across different NPU architectures. TensorFlow requires different tools (TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js) for different deployment targets, while Neurenix uses the same API everywhere.

### Neurenix vs. PyTorch

| **Quantization** | Automatic quantization | Manual quantization |
| **Mobile Integration** | Native support | Requires PyTorch Mobile |
| **Edge Deployment** | Direct deployment | Requires conversion |
| **Performance Optimization** | Automatic optimization | Manual optimization |

PyTorch has limited NPU support compared to Neurenix, focusing primarily on CUDA GPUs. Neurenix's unified API and automatic optimizations make it easier to deploy models to NPUs without manual intervention.

### Neurenix vs. Scikit-Learn

| Feature | Neurenix | Scikit-Learn |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **NPU Support** | Comprehensive support | No NPU support |
| **Deep Learning** | Native support | Limited support |
| **Hardware Acceleration** | Multiple backends | CPU only |
| **Quantization** | Automatic quantization | No quantization |
| **Edge Deployment** | Direct deployment | Not designed for edge |
| **Performance Optimization** | Automatic optimization | Limited optimization |

Scikit-Learn does not provide NPU support or hardware acceleration, focusing on CPU-based machine learning algorithms. Neurenix's NPU support enables significant performance improvements for deep learning models on specialized hardware.

## Future Work

Future development of the NPU backend will include:

1. **Expanded Vendor Support**: Support for more NPU architectures
2. **Improved Quantization**: Better quantization algorithms for higher accuracy
3. **Dynamic Shape Support**: Better handling of dynamic input shapes
4. **Custom Operation Support**: Easier integration of custom operations
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Further optimizations for specific NPU architectures
6. **Automatic Fallback**: Graceful fallback to CPU for unsupported operations
