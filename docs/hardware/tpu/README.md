## Usage

### Checking for TPU Availability

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.tpu import is_tpu_available

if is_tpu_available():
    print("TPU is available")
else:
    print("TPU is not available")
```

### Creating a TPU Backend

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.tpu import TPUBackend

# Create the backend
try:
    tpu = TPUBackend()
    
    # Initialize the backend
    if tpu.initialize():
        print("TPU backend initialized successfully")
    else:
        print("Failed to initialize TPU backend")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"TPU error: {e}")
```

### Creating a TPU Device

```python
# Python
from neurenix.device import Device, DeviceType

# Create a TPU device
tpu_device = Device(DeviceType.TPU, 0)

# Check if the device is available
if tpu_device.is_available():
    print("TPU device is available")
else:
    print("TPU device is not available")
```

### Creating a Tensor on TPU

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.device import Device, DeviceType

# Create a tensor on TPU
tensor = nx.Tensor([1, 2, 3, 4], device=Device(DeviceType.TPU, 0))
```

```cpp
// C++
auto tensor = phynexus::Tensor({2, 3}, phynexus::DataType::FLOAT32, 
                              phynexus::Device(phynexus::DeviceType::TPU, 0));
```

```rust
// Rust
let tensor = Tensor::new(vec![2, 3], DataType::Float32, Device::tpu(0))?;
```

### Using TPU for Tensor Operations

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.device import Device, DeviceType

# Create tensors on TPU
a = nx.Tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], device=Device(DeviceType.TPU, 0))
b = nx.Tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]], device=Device(DeviceType.TPU, 0))

# Perform matrix multiplication
c = nx.matmul(a, b)
print(f"Result: {c}")
```

### Optimizing a Model for TPU

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.nn import Sequential, Linear, ReLU
from neurenix.device import Device, DeviceType

# Create a model
model = Sequential(
    Linear(10, 20),
    ReLU(),
    Linear(20, 5)
)

# Move the model to TPU
model.to(Device(DeviceType.TPU, 0))

# Run inference on TPU
input_tensor = nx.Tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]], device=Device(DeviceType.TPU, 0))
output = model(input_tensor)
```

The TPU backend implementation in Phynexus follows a layered architecture:

1. **Python API Layer**: Provides a user-friendly interface for TPU operations
2. **Rust Binding Layer**: Connects the Python API to the C++ implementation
3. **C++ Implementation Layer**: Implements the core TPU functionality

### TPU Integration

The implementation uses the TPU API to:

1. Initialize the TPU device
2. Allocate memory on the TPU
3. Transfer data between host and TPU
4. Execute operations on the TPU
5. Manage resources efficiently

### Memory Management

The implementation includes efficient memory management:

1. **Device Memory Allocation**: Allocate memory on the TPU
2. **Memory Pooling**: Reuse memory allocations when possible
3. **Automatic Garbage Collection**: Free unused memory
4. **Memory Transfer Optimization**: Minimize host-device transfers

### Operation Optimization

2. **Layout Optimization**: Use TPU-friendly memory layouts
3. **Batch Processing**: Optimize for batch operations
4. **Compiler Optimizations**: Leverage TPU compiler optimizations

## Best Practices

### Model Design for TPU

For optimal performance on TPUs:

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.nn import Sequential, Linear, ReLU
from neurenix.device import Device, DeviceType

# Create a TPU-friendly model
# - Use power-of-two dimensions
# - Avoid complex control flow
# - Use supported operations
model = Sequential(
    Linear(1024, 1024),  # Power-of-two dimensions
    ReLU(),
    Linear(1024, 1024),
    ReLU(),
    Linear(1024, 10)
)

# Move the model to TPU
model.to(Device(DeviceType.TPU, 0))
```

### Batch Size Selection

Choose appropriate batch sizes for TPUs:

```python
# Python
# For Cloud TPUs, use larger batch sizes
batch_size = 1024

# For Edge TPUs, use smaller batch sizes
batch_size = 1
```

### Data Layout

Use TPU-friendly data layouts:

```python
# Python
# For image data, use NHWC layout (batch, height, width, channels)
# instead of NCHW layout (batch, channels, height, width)
```

## Framework Comparison

### Neurenix vs. TensorFlow

| Feature | Neurenix | TensorFlow |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **TPU Support** | Integrated with unified API | Native but separate API |
| **Edge TPU Support** | Comprehensive | Limited |
| **API Consistency** | Same API across all hardware | TPU-specific API |
| **Memory Management** | Automatic | Manual configuration |
| **Operation Support** | Growing set of operations | Comprehensive |
| **Integration Complexity** | Low | Medium |

TensorFlow has more mature TPU support as it's developed by Google, the creator of TPUs. However, Neurenix provides a more unified experience with the same API across different hardware backends, making it easier to switch between TPU and other devices.

### Neurenix vs. PyTorch

| Feature | Neurenix | PyTorch |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **TPU Support** | Native integration | Third-party (PyTorch/XLA) |
| **Edge TPU Support** | Comprehensive | Limited |
| **API Consistency** | Same API across all hardware | Requires XLA bridge |
| **Memory Management** | Automatic | Manual configuration |
| **Operation Support** | Growing set of operations | Limited by XLA |
| **Integration Complexity** | Low | High |

PyTorch requires the PyTorch/XLA bridge for TPU support, which adds complexity and may not support all PyTorch operations. Neurenix's native TPU support provides a more integrated experience with better compatibility.

### Neurenix vs. Scikit-Learn

| Feature | Neurenix | Scikit-Learn |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **TPU Support** | Comprehensive | None |
