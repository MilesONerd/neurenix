## Usage

### Checking for Vulkan Availability

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.vulkan import is_vulkan_available

if is_vulkan_available():
    print("Vulkan is available")
else:
    print("Vulkan is not available")
```

### Creating a Vulkan Backend

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.vulkan import VulkanBackend

# Create the backend
try:
    vulkan = VulkanBackend()
    
    # Initialize the backend
    if vulkan.initialize():
        print("Vulkan backend initialized successfully")
    else:
        print("Failed to initialize Vulkan backend")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Vulkan error: {e}")
```

### Getting Device Information

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.vulkan import VulkanBackend

# Create and initialize the backend
vulkan = VulkanBackend()
vulkan.initialize()

# Get the number of available devices
device_count = vulkan.get_device_count()
print(f"Available Vulkan devices: {device_count}")

# Get information about a specific device
device_info = vulkan.get_device_info(0)  # First device
print(f"Device info: {device_info}")
```

### Using Vulkan for Tensor Operations

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.hardware.vulkan import VulkanBackend

# Create tensors
a = nx.Tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = nx.Tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Create and initialize the backend
vulkan = VulkanBackend()
vulkan.initialize()

# Perform matrix multiplication using Vulkan
c = vulkan.matmul(a, b)
print(f"Result: {c}")
```

### Using Vulkan for Convolution

```python
# Python
import neurenix as nx
from neurenix.hardware.vulkan import VulkanBackend

# Create input and weight tensors
input = nx.random.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)  # Batch, Channels, Height, Width
weight = nx.random.randn(16, 3, 3, 3)  # Out channels, In channels, Kernel H, Kernel W

# Create and initialize the backend
vulkan = VulkanBackend()
vulkan.initialize()

# Perform 2D convolution using Vulkan
output = vulkan.conv2d(
    input=input,
    weight=weight,
    bias=None,
    stride=(1, 1),
    padding=(1, 1)
)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

### Creating and Executing Custom Vulkan Compute Shaders

```python
# Python
# In a real implementation, you would have a method like this:
# vulkan.execute_shader(shader_code, input_buffers, output_buffers, workgroup_size)
```

## Implementation Details

The Vulkan backend implementation in Phynexus follows a layered architecture:

1. **Python API Layer**: Provides a user-friendly interface for Vulkan operations
2. **Rust Binding Layer**: Connects the Python API to the C++ implementation
3. **C++ Implementation Layer**: Implements the core Vulkan functionality

### Vulkan Integration

The implementation uses the Vulkan API to:

1. Create a Vulkan instance and enumerate physical devices
2. Select appropriate physical devices for compute operations
3. Create logical devices and compute queues
4. Manage command pools and command buffers
5. Create and manage buffers for tensor data
6. Compile and execute compute shaders
7. Synchronize operations using fences and semaphores

### Memory Management

The implementation includes explicit memory management:

1. **Device Memory Allocation**: Allocate memory on the GPU
2. **Buffer Creation**: Create buffers for tensor data
3. **Memory Mapping**: Map host memory to device memory for data transfer
4. **Memory Barriers**: Ensure proper synchronization between operations

### Shader Management

The implementation includes compute shader management:

1. **Shader Compilation**: Compile GLSL compute shaders to SPIR-V
2. **Shader Module Creation**: Create Vulkan shader modules
3. **Pipeline Creation**: Create compute pipelines with appropriate layouts
4. **Descriptor Sets**: Manage descriptor sets for shader inputs and outputs

## Best Practices

### Device Selection

When multiple Vulkan-compatible devices are available:

```python
# Python
from neurenix.hardware.vulkan import VulkanBackend

# Create the backend
vulkan = VulkanBackend()
vulkan.initialize()

# Get the number of available devices
device_count = vulkan.get_device_count()

# Get information about all devices
for i in range(device_count):
    device_info = vulkan.get_device_info(i)
    print(f"Device {i}: {device_info}")

# Select the best device based on your requirements
# (In a real implementation, you would choose based on device capabilities)
```

### Memory Management

For optimal performance with Vulkan:

1. **Minimize Host-Device Transfers**: Keep data on the GPU as much as possible
2. **Use Device Local Memory**: For data that stays on the GPU
3. **Use Host Visible Memory**: For data that needs to be transferred frequently
4. **Batch Operations**: Group operations together when possible

### Shader Optimization

For best performance with Vulkan compute shaders:

1. **Workgroup Size**: Choose appropriate workgroup sizes for your device
2. **Memory Access Patterns**: Ensure coalesced memory access
3. **Shared Memory**: Use shared memory for frequently accessed data
4. **Avoid Divergence**: Minimize control flow divergence within workgroups
