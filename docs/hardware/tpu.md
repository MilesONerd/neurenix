# TPU Support in Phynexus

This document describes the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) support in the Phynexus framework.

## Overview

Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specialized hardware accelerators designed specifically for machine learning workloads, particularly for neural network training and inference. Phynexus now includes support for TPUs alongside its existing support for CPUs, CUDA GPUs, ROCm GPUs, and WebGPU.

## Features

The TPU backend in Phynexus provides:

- Tensor operations on TPU devices
- Memory management for TPU devices
- Data transfer between host and TPU devices
- Support for all standard Phynexus tensor operations

## Usage

### Creating a TPU Device

```cpp
// C++
auto device = phynexus::Device(phynexus::DeviceType::TPU, 0);
```

```rust
// Rust
let device = Device::tpu(0);
```

### Creating a Tensor on TPU

```cpp
// C++
auto tensor = phynexus::Tensor({2, 3}, phynexus::DataType::FLOAT32, 
                              phynexus::Device(phynexus::DeviceType::TPU, 0));
```

```rust
// Rust
let tensor = Tensor::new(vec![2, 3], DataType::Float32, Device::tpu(0))?;
```

### Checking for TPU Availability

```cpp
// C++
bool is_available = device.is_available();
```

```rust
// Rust
let is_available = device.is_available()?;
```

## Implementation Details

The TPU backend implementation in Phynexus follows the same architecture as other hardware backends:

1. A `DeviceType::TPU` enum value to identify TPU devices
2. TPU-specific memory management functions
3. TPU-specific implementations of tensor operations
4. A TPU backend that implements the `Backend` trait/interface

The current implementation provides placeholder functions that will be replaced with actual TPU API calls in future updates.

## Limitations

The current TPU implementation has the following limitations:

- Limited to placeholder implementations that do not yet interact with actual TPU hardware
- No support for TPU-specific optimizations
- No support for TPU-specific operations

These limitations will be addressed in future updates as the TPU backend is further developed.

## Future Work

Future development of the TPU backend will include:

- Integration with actual TPU hardware APIs
- TPU-specific optimizations for common operations
- Support for TPU-specific operations and features
- Performance benchmarks and comparisons with other hardware backends
